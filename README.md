# Aveksha

Today as we are moving towards a gender-diverse work culture it is really important that we ensure the safety of our female peers. Due to a lot of Twitter hatred, bullying, and threats many women are afraid of voicing out their opinions on social media platforms like Twitter. This not only creates an unhealthy environment but also severely affects the mental health of women. With Aveksha we can stop these trolls as it will keep an eye on such people and will help the cyber cell and other responsible authorities in locating the actual culprits. The website has been built with a feature where we can select our specific location and see the list of top hate speech users.
